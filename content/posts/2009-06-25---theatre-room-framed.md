Here's our first update on the status of the theatre room. Over the last week or so we've managed to complete the following:

* Framing (just need to frame in the window).
* Boxes for the front speakers, power, and side lights.
* Ran PVC pipe to each speaker box and then back through the roof to where the cabinet will house all of the electronics.
* Mounted the projector bracket.

The screen arrived yesterday so tonight we'll do our first test run with the screen and projector. Sunday we plan to finish the last of the framing and run all of the electrical so we can start dry wall sometime next week. I also just placed an order for all of the electronics related wiring through monoprice.com:

* $19.01 x2 : 14AWG Enhanced Loud Oxygen-Free Copper Speaker Wire Cable - 100ft
* $13.28 x2 : High Speed HDMI 1.3a Category 2 Certified CL2 Rated (In-Wall Installation) Cable (24AWG) w/ Net Jacket - 15ft (Gold Plated Connectors)
