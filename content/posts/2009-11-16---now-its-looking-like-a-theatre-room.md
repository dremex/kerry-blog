After taking a few months off we've finished more of the theatre room. This weekend we wrapped up painting the ceiling slats, window frame, and installed a set of blinds.

We'll be installing the flooring later this week (which means I have to finish putting the cement sealer on the floor... I'm not looking forward to that)

For anyone concerned with the acoustic problems a wood floor may cause, there will be a sound absorbing layer underneath the wood and we plan to add an area rug for the middle of the room that should soak up sound at the proper bounce angles.
