Yesterday Jamie and I ran a 5k put on by a local high school. This was Jamie's first 5k and my 3rd so we were pretty stoked to see how well we would do.

The run was great and we did pretty good however I was disappointed that the race statistics didn't have a break down by age group, instead there was one massive list containing everyone in the order they finished: [http://www.utah.usatf.org/assoc/ut/lepresults10.htm](http://www.utah.usatf.org/assoc/ut/lepresults10.htm)

I enjoy looking at my age group to see how I rank when compared to others near my age so I decided to write a quick script to generate age groups for the race: [http://www.xmech.net/Leopards5kAgeGroups.html](http://www.xmech.net/Leopards5kAgeGroups.html)

I did much better than my last 5k (4th out of 5th in my age group) and I hope to be in the top 10 next time.
