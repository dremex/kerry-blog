After roughly four months of development, I'm happy to announce that our first Android game is out the door! We actually turned the release key about a week ago and in that time we've had two people purchase our paid version (ad free) and received 114 downloads for our free version.

We have an additional mode and new holiday themed levels in the pipeline.
