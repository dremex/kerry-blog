We had a productive weekend in the theatre room. All of the electrical (lights and outlets), PVC pipe for wires, and the last of the framing (around the window) is complete. All of our wires should be arriving later today so we can glue the PVC and string the wires through later tonight. We're hoping to start dry walling mid week if the budget can hold up to it.
