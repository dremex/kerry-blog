After almost exactly four years of hosting Xmech with hostmonster, I've finally moved to my own VPS from Linode. I've been really pleased with hostmonster and I would highly recommend them however I've come to a point where I require more control over the server hosting my projects (installing specific applications, libraries, etc) and a VPS is the way to go.

There are quite a few VPS providers out there but after a few hours of research I've decided to go with Linode due to the high customer praise, affordable prices, and a great community.
