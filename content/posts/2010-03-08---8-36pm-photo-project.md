While browsing twitter I found a reference to something called the "8:36 project". The idea is to take a picture of what you're doing (no matter how mundane) at exactly 8:36 PM every day.

Being able to look back at your collection of photos will allow you to build an idea of how your life unfolded through a given month, year, and beyond.

To start things off I snapped a picture Sunday night:

Jamie and I decided to try and make some Gnocchi for dinner (it's always nice to spend some time together cooking) and it turned out great.

I'll be posting my photos to my picasa album and hope to continue this indefinitely.
